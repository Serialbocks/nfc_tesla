WIP - User application for the Flipper Zero embedded device for reading and mimicking the Tesla Model 3 Key Card protocol.

Reading and performing the public key signing and verification works and is complete.
Mimicking the card is partially working as one flipper recognizes another flipper mimicking the device, but the authentication handshake fails. The car also seems to not respond to the flipper.
